fold now has init modifier
    [3]ſ¹+
    ⯈ 4

ᴍ: now handles strings well
ᴍⁿ: n layered map
    [1⋄2,3⋄4] ᴍ² √
    ⯈ [[1.0, 1.4142135623730951], [1.7320508075688772, 2.0]]
ᴍ⁻ⁿ: layers above any atom
    confusing so like:
        ["some", ["cool", [[["strings"]]]]] ᴍ⁻² ᴙ
        ⯈ ['emos', ['looc', [[['sgnirts']]]]]
        ["some", ["cool", [[["h"]]]]] ᴍ⁻¹ ᔐ.upper
        ⯈ [['S', 'O', 'M', 'E'], [['C', 'O', 'O', 'L'], [[[['H']]]]]]
         i think ᴍ⁻¹ is the same as ᴍ󰂃...?
ᴍ󰂃: also a thing
ꟿⁿ: starmap works the same way
  
Where '⨁' ⫢ operator
  ⨁󰀂ᴬᴾ󰀙    ⟶ ⨁["󰀂ᴬᴾ󰀙"]
  ⨁ᵃ       ⟶ ⨁[a]
  ⨁¹⁺¹     ⟶ ⨁[1+1]
  ⨁¹⁺¹𐞑ᴶ𐞑ˣ ⟶ ⨁[1+1,"J",x]

Keybinded ⥉, 𐞑
Changed binds for ⟥⟤

"egg"⬄"g"
⯈ "e"
needs more work to be more general

made ⟥ and ⟤ work... maybe? i think?

tracebacks show the python code now, terrible monkey things had to be done to do it

added ≺, basically
    1⋄2≺+
    ⯈ 3

* Added hex, binary, and octal parsing
* Random fixes, one tricky peggle bug
* Added some more test cases
We still have the bugs with op swapping and stuff not chaning pres orders

* Added some normalization to some paths
* Trim the caller program from argv

added 
    it just calls a function
    "f " is "f()"

fixed hex lol

Added basic cli mode, tldr "☾" with no args opens it.
refresher is "☾ --refresher"

added install script [linux only rn]

fixed bug with tracebacks
(Need to fix cli mode not showing errors)

ᴍ and ꟿ support ᴰ ᴷ ⱽ for mapping dicts, dict keys, and dict values

added 𝑡 for tuples b/c it was missing for some reason

print flush by default (idk if this changes anything but it don't hurt)

added bindings (and fixed a bug) for special string chars i.e. 𝗻

added ⍭, basically (use special char highlighting PLS):
    ‹a b›⍭ = ['a', 'b']
    ‹k j a b›⍭ = [['k','j'], ['a','b']]

added 𝔦𝔪𝔭(␛s), imports some misc sys related things for ease of use

Working on massive overhaul for compose/font stuff!

AAAAAAAAAAAAAa
ehehehhehe

ⴳ, ⴴ now have a self-returning call method

we now have
    ⨳ 󰻾(22) ≡ 22
    ⨳ 󰻾¹⁴("hiii") ≡ 14

Ϝ: accumulate
ℵᵒᵖᵗⁱᵒⁿᵃˡ􋕟ᵈᵉᶠᵃᵘˡᵗ: attr dict (iter does .items)
ℶᵒᵖᵗⁱᵒⁿᵃˡ􋕟ᵈᵉᶠᵃᵘˡᵗ: attr dict (iter does .values)
󰑅, 󰑅ᴵ: first, first index of
󰑁, 󰑃 : before, after
ƒ  (a1,a2,⬤,j=22,h=⬤): partial function
ƒ: automatically star a function's args
(also 􊽺, which is cool for stuff like ≡)

ᙎᙡᗢᙧ: windowz
ᣆ: apply func if...
$ᵒecho epic subprocess calls󷹹

oh also everything has sub/sup/subsub/subsup/supsub/supsup scripts
oh also font remaking thingy finished check out CONFIGURE.☾ in FontCompose

ok superscripts should now act like exponents when the parsed thing isn't an identifier
⨳ 2² ≡ 4  😊

Added gambling 😊😊😊
     /󱅏/ ᴺ : list of N of the random thing
      /󱅏   = uniform(¯1, 1)/uniform(0, 1)

a∣b: ✓/✗ if a divides b
a∤b: take a guess

ℇ is now euler's constant

exponents are now fun 5􊽲 = √5
    [󷹇 uses hard-coded list of single char identifiers]

fixed nested ≔ and <op>= calls
