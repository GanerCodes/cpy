fold now has init modifier
    [3]ſ¹+
    ⯈ 4

ᴍ: now handles strings well
ᴍⁿ: n layered map
    [1⋄2,3⋄4] ᴍ² √
    ⯈ [[1.0, 1.4142135623730951], [1.7320508075688772, 2.0]]
ᴍ⁻ⁿ: layers above any atom
    confusing so like:
        ["some", ["cool", [[["strings"]]]]] ᴍ⁻² ᴙ
        ⯈ ['emos', ['looc', [[['sgnirts']]]]]
        ["some", ["cool", [[["h"]]]]] ᴍ⁻¹ ᔐ.upper
        ⯈ [['S', 'O', 'M', 'E'], [['C', 'O', 'O', 'L'], [[[['H']]]]]]
         i think ᴍ⁻¹ is the same as ᴍ󰂃...?
ᴍ󰂃: also a thing
ꟿⁿ: starmap works the same way
  
Where '⨁' ⫢ operator
  ⨁󰀂ᴬᴾ󰀙    ⟶ ⨁["󰀂ᴬᴾ󰀙"]
  ⨁ᵃ       ⟶ ⨁[a]
  ⨁¹⁺¹     ⟶ ⨁[1+1]
  ⨁¹⁺¹𐞑ᴶ𐞑ˣ ⟶ ⨁[1+1,"J",x]

Keybinded ⥉, 𐞑
Changed binds for ⟥⟤

"egg"⬄"g"
⯈ "e"
needs more work to be more general

made ⟥ and ⟤ work... maybe? i think?

tracebacks show the python code now, terrible monkey things had to be done to do it

added ≺, basically
    1⋄2≺+
    ⯈ 3

* Added hex, binary, and octal parsing
* Random fixes, one tricky peggle bug
* Added some more test cases
We still have the bugs with op swapping and stuff not chaning pres orders

* Added some normalization to some paths
* Trim the caller program from argv

added 
    it just calls a function
    "f " is "f()"

fixed hex lol

Added basic cli mode, tldr "☾" with no args opens it.
refresher is "☾ --refresher"

added install script [linux only rn]

fixed bug with tracebacks
(Need to fix cli mode not showing errors)

ᴍ and ꟿ support ᴰ ᴷ ⱽ for mapping dicts, dict keys, and dict values

added 𝑡 for tuples b/c it was missing for some reason

print flush by default (idk if this changes anything but it don't hurt)
