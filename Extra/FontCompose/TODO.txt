1. Hardcode some define big open PUA areas
    [100000 - 10FFFF] gives 65k
        this is a lot-ish but if we need more we should have support for more ranges
2. for all symnames (i.e. "Î±_sup") that we have defined, put them into their spots.
3. choose a RANDOM (so two people dont add chars to the same place) consecuitive space in PUA for the rest of the symbols to add 
4. add the chars and the range to the magic log file
